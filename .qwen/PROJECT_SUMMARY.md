# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Run and maintain a Vue.js frontend application located at `/root/pkumi/yishu_pc`.

## Key Knowledge
- Project is a Vue.js application (evidenced by `vue.config.js`, `App.vue`, `main.js`)
- Standard Vue CLI structure with `public/` and `src/` directories
- Development server is started with `npm run serve`
- Currently no runtime errors or build issues observed
- Application runs on default port (likely 8080)

## Recent Actions
- Successfully launched Vue development server in background using `npm run serve`
- Server started without errors (Exit Code: 0)
- Application should be accessible at http://localhost:8080

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Launch development server
2. [TODO] Verify application is accessible and functioning correctly
3. [TODO] Monitor for any runtime errors or issues
4. [TODO] Prepare for potential feature development or debugging requests
